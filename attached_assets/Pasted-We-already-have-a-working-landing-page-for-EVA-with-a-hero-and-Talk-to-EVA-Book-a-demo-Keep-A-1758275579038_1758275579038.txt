We already have a working landing page for EVA with a hero and “Talk to EVA” + “Book a demo.” Keep ALL current styling and layout. Do NOT change the hero. The hero already includes the credibility line “Built on infrastructure proven across 62M+ calls.” Leave that as-is.

Add the following sections directly below the hero and above the footer, using existing fonts/colors/spacing. Keep it responsive, fast, and minimal. Prioritize accessibility (semantic tags, alt text) and SEO (proper heading hierarchy).

Authority Statement Section

Use <section> with an internal anchor id authority.

<h2>: “The future of business calls is here.”

<p>: “Voice AI is changing how companies handle phone calls worldwide — now EVA brings that same technology to small businesses.”

Centered layout, max-width ~720px, plenty of white space.

Integrations Strip

Use <section> with id integrations.

<h2>: “Works with the tools you already use.”

Render a row (wrap on mobile) of neutral, monochrome logo images or pill placeholders if assets aren’t available. Include these items in this order:
Google Calendar · Slack · HubSpot · Calendly · Zapier · WhatsApp · SMS · Gmail · Outlook

Each item must have descriptive alt text like “Google Calendar integration”, “WhatsApp integration”, “SMS integration”, “Gmail integration”, “Outlook integration”.

Sub-line <p>: “EVA connects with your calendar, CRM, messaging apps, and email — so she fits seamlessly into your workflow.”

Keep everything visually lightweight (no heavy images).

Trust Badges Row (SAFE claims only)

Use <section> with id trust.

Render four pill-style cards in a row (wrap on mobile), subtle shadow, rounded:

“24/7 Availability”

“Enterprise-grade Infrastructure”

“Built on infrastructure proven across 62M+ calls” ← KEEP THIS EXACT WORDING

“Fits into your existing workflow”

Use <ul>/<li> or accessible <div role="list"> with <div role="listitem">.

CTA Repeat Section

Use <section> with id get-started.

<h2>: “Ready to see EVA in action?”

Two buttons side-by-side (stack on mobile):

Primary: “Talk to EVA” (anchor-scroll to the live widget section already on the page)

Secondary: “Book a 10-min demo” (use the existing Calendly link)

Maintain existing button styles (purple primary).

Navigation & linking

If the navbar has “Features / Pricing / Try Demo / Book a Call,” make “Try Demo” anchor to the live widget, and “Book a Call” anchor to #get-started (or open Calendly).

Add skip-to-content link for accessibility.

SEO & accessibility specifics

Use semantic tags: <section>, <h2>, <p>, <ul>.

Heading order should remain valid (no skipping levels).

All logos have descriptive alt text.

Add meaningful ids (authority, integrations, trust, get-started) for anchor links.

Keep copy EXACTLY as provided.

Do NOT add any claims beyond what’s here. No uptime figures, no % improvements, no vague superlatives.

Performance

Avoid large images; prefer SVGs or lightweight placeholders.

Respect current CSS tokens/utility classes; only add minimal CSS if needed.

Test mobile: logos wrap, badges wrap, buttons full-width on small screens.
